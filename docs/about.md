This blog is where I look at how emerging technologies impact established industries, and what that might mean
for the players on each side. That's not always as easy as "new = better", or even "better is better". Fundamentally,
I explore whether there is a problem that customers will pay to solve. On the way, I'll take diversions into history, finance,
technology, and anything else that looks interesting. This is my personal blog, after all. And of course,
it does not and need not reflect the views and position of any employer, past, present or future.
