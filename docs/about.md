This blog is where I share things I know, and things I learn. It's always good to learn, right?
Mainly I write about business and technology, but along the way, I'll take diversions into history, books,
and anything else that looks interesting. This is my personal blog, after all. And of course,
it does not and need not reflect the views and position of any employer, past, present, or future.
