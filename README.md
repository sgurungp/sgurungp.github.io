This repo contains the source files for [my blog](https://sgurungp.github.io).

The tech stack for the blog is: source files in the 'docs' folder >> Jekyll static site generator >> GitHub Pages hosting.

In other words, I write articles in Markdown, Jekyll converts them and does all the heavy lifting to create web pages, 
and GitHub Pages automatically updates the website when changes are detected.

See: [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/pages) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for more info.
